# XXL application

this was a group project with [@rodrigomfc](https://github.com/rodrigomfc) and as such I simply forked the project.

* Core: `xxl-core` contains the domain classes
* Interaction: `xxl-app` contains the user interaction classes

The po-uilib folder and corresponding classes have been provided by the university and corresponding course.

## how to run:
- go to directory `spreadsheet-uni`
- run command:
`export CLASSPATH=/home/user-name/Documents/spreadsheet-uni/xxl-app/xxl-app.jar:/home/user-name/Documents/spreadsheet-uni/xxl-core/xxl-core.jar:/home/user-name/Documents/winfiles/spreadsheet-uni/po-uilib.jar`
- run `java xxl.app.App`
